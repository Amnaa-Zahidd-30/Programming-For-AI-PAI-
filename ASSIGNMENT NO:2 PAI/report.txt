Conclusion:
The data generally supports the 'Women and Children First' hypothesis. As seen above, females and younger passengers (children) show a higher mean survival rate compared to males and adult passengers. This pattern aligns with the historical claim that women and children were prioritized during the Titanic evacuation.
